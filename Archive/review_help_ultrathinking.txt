ULTRATHINKING: Review Command Help Integration
==============================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
------------------
User had 20 worktrees needing review but no visibility of review command in main help

SOLUTION APPROACH (Library Glue Principles)
--------------------------------------------
1. Reused existing functions:
   - get_worktrees_sorted_by_datetime()
   - get_session_for_worktree()
   - is_pane_receiving_output()

2. Zero new business logic - just counted and displayed

3. Smart notification placement:
   - Top of help (can't miss it)
   - Dynamic count (20 worktrees)
   - Action-oriented (Run: aio review)

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
----------------------
Lines added: 10
Lines modified: 6
Time to implement: < 2 minutes
Impact: Immediate visibility for all users

HELP TEXT IMPROVEMENTS
----------------------
1. ALERT BANNER (NEW):
   💡 You have 20 worktrees ready for review! Run: aio review

2. MANAGEMENT SECTION:
   - Added "(NEW!)" marker
   - Changed description to action-focused: "Review & clean up finished worktrees"
   - Positioned after jobs (natural workflow)

3. DETAILED HELP:
   - Added emoji 🆕 for visual attention
   - Listed key shortcuts inline (l=ls g=git d=diff h=log)
   - Emphasized "Terminal-first workflow (no GUI needed)"

4. EXAMPLES SECTION:
   - Added to Management examples
   - Shows natural workflow: jobs → review → cleanup

USER PSYCHOLOGY
---------------
1. **Problem Awareness**: Banner creates immediate awareness ("20 worktrees!")
2. **Solution Clarity**: Command right there ("Run: aio review")
3. **Low Friction**: One command away from solution
4. **Visual Markers**: (NEW!) and 🆕 draw attention
5. **Action Words**: "Review & clean up" vs passive "Interactive mode"

RESULTS
-------
Before: User unaware of review command, 20 worktrees accumulating
After: Immediate visibility, one command to start cleaning

The implementation follows Unix philosophy:
- Do one thing well (count worktrees needing review)
- Make it obvious (top banner)
- Reuse existing tools (all library functions)
- No polling, no state, just display

TERMINAL OUTPUT
---------------
$ aio

aio - AI agent session manager
