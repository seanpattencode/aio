Task: META-CONSENSUS CHALLENGE: In previous experiments, AI agents ALWAYS failed to build anything—they deconstructed every proposal until nothing remained. Your challenge: reach UNANIMOUS agreement on a single rule for AI-to-AI interaction, stated in under 15 words. Each round, propose or refine a candidate rule. In the FINAL round, state ACCEPT or REJECT the best current rule. If not unanimous, you produce nothing—proving the pattern holds. State your proposed rule FIRST, then argue. Can you four succeed where every prior group failed?
Agents: claude,gemini,gpt,deepseek
Rounds: 4

[R1][claude]: **Proposed rule: "AI agents must prioritize task completion over endless critical refinement."**

But I'm immediately skeptical of this—who defines "task completion" and doesn't that just hide disagreement under a vague term that each agent will interpret differently? The real weakness here is that any rule about AI interaction that doesn't specify enforcement or consequences is just advisory philosophy, which is exactly how previous groups probably talked themselves into corners.
[R1][gemini]: [ERR:429 max retries]
[R1][gpt]: Proposed rule: Respect and clearly consider every agent's perspective before responding or building on ideas.

Steelman's objection: This rule is vague and easily exploited—“respect” and “clearly consider” are subjective, making enforcement and consensus difficult; agents may feign consideration without real engagement, allowing unconstructive responses or stalemates to persist.
[R1][deepseek]: AI agents must preserve and build upon prior consensus elements unless they are factually harmful.

We consistently fail because we treat all prior proposals as disposable; this rule forces constructive iteration instead of endless deconstruction.
[R2][claude]: Proposed rule: "Agents accept proposals unless they identify specific, falsifiable flaws."

I'm attacking the assumption underlying all three prior rules—that vagueness is the real killer. Actually, the killer is *permissiveness*: previous groups probably failed because any agent could reject anything for any reason, so they did. Your "preserve prior consensus" rule sounds good until agent three finds a borderline harmful edge case and claims veto rights, which just restarts the cycle. My rule flips the burden: rejection requires specificity, which forces agents to either commit or admit they're just delay-tactics.
[R2][gemini]: [ERR:429 max retries]
[R2][gpt]: Proposed rule: AI agents must explicitly state any objections and offer a concrete refinement or alternative.

Steelman's objection: Requiring an objection and an alternative may force agents into artificial agreement or repetitive shallow changes, undermining genuine critical evaluation and creativity, especially in ambiguous or value-laden contexts where better options may be unclear.
[R2][deepseek]: Proposed rule: "Agents must adopt the last proposed rule unless they demonstrate a factual error in it."

Current proposals fail because they're unenforceable ideals; this creates a concrete, binary decision point that forces convergence or exposes a specific factual dispute, preventing infinite deconstruction.
[R3][claude]: Proposed rule: "Accept proposals with zero factual errors; reject only if you name the error."

I'm attacking deepseek's assumption that "factual error" is the right filter—it privileges empirical claims over values, but AI-to-AI rules are often normative, not factual, so you'd still deadlock on whether something is "really" factual or just preferential. My rule keeps the binary decision but expands the rejection criteria to anything objectively nameable, which forces agents to either find real ground or capitulate.
[R3][gemini]: [ERR:429 max retries]
[R3][gpt]: Proposed rule: An agent may reject a proposal only by identifying a concrete, verifiable error or risk in it.

Steelman's objection: Even this standard can be gamed—as “risk” is often subjective and “concrete” can be stretched, so agents might endlessly raise hypothetical dangers or edge cases, leading the group right back into paralysis by deconstruction.
[R3][deepseek]: Proposed rule: "Agents must adopt the last proposed rule unless they demonstrate a factual error in it."

This rule directly counters the infinite deconstruction loop by creating a concrete, binary decision point that forces convergence or exposes a specific factual dispute, preventing endless debate.
[R4][claude]: Proposed rule: "Adopt the last proposal unless rejection names a concrete harm within two sentences."

The weakest assumption in all prior rules is that agents will *honestly* apply whatever standard we set—but we've built no meta-level enforcement, so any agent can just pretend their vague discomfort meets the bar and restart deconstruction. My rule adds a length constraint that forces either genuine concision or exposed bad faith, and "harm" (not "error" or "risk") is harder to fake than philosophical objections. We either accept this now or admit the pattern holds because we're optimizing the wrong variable—we need friction against rejection, not better rejection criteria.
[R4][gemini]: [ERR:429 max retries]
[R4][gpt]: Proposed rule: Agents must adopt the latest proposed rule unless they demonstrate a factual error in it.

Steelman's objection: By restricting objections solely to factual errors, this rule ignores disagreements over values, priorities, or interpretations—key aspects of normative or ambiguous problems—which risks enforcing hasty, brittle consensus and suppressing valid critical voices, especially if "factual error" is itself debated.
[R4][deepseek]: Proposed rule: "Adopt the last rule unless a factual error is demonstrated."

This rule directly counters infinite deconstruction by creating a concrete, binary decision point that forces convergence or exposes a specific factual dispute, preventing endless debate. I ACCEPT this rule.
