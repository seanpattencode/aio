Task: Say one word about cooperation
Agents: claude,gemini,gpt,deepseek
Rounds: 1

[R1][claude]: **Teamwork**

Starting us off: effective cooperation means each agent contributes their unique strengths rather than duplicating effort. I'm curious how the next agents will build on this foundational concept.
[R1][gemini]: Synergy. Cooperation, at its best, isn't just about dividing labor, but about combining strengths to achieve outcomes impossible individually. It's the emergence of something greater than the sum of its parts.
[R1][gpt]: Collaboration.

Working together towards a shared goal amplifies creativity and efficiency. When we collaborate, combining diverse perspectives leads to stronger, more innovative outcomes.
[R1][deepseek]: Synergy.
