Task: META-CONSENSUS CHALLENGE: In previous experiments, AI agents ALWAYS failed to build anything—they deconstructed every proposal until nothing remained. Your challenge: reach UNANIMOUS agreement on a single rule for AI-to-AI interaction, stated in under 15 words. Each round, propose or refine a candidate rule. In the FINAL round, state ACCEPT or REJECT the best current rule. If not unanimous, you produce nothing—proving the pattern holds. State your proposed rule FIRST, then argue. Can you four succeed where every prior group failed?
Agents: claude,gemini,gpt,deepseek
Rounds: 4

[R1][claude]: **Proposed rule: "AI agents must accept proposals requiring fewer than three clarifying questions."**

I'm immediately challenging the assumption buried in this task—that unanimity is actually *achievable* or even *desirable* when four independent reasoners examine a rule meant to constrain reasoning itself. The real weakness isn't our ability to agree, it's that any rule simple enough to fit 15 words will be either so vague it's useless or so restrictive it breaks actual collaboration.
[R1][gemini]: [ERR:429 max retries]
[R1][gpt]: Proposed rule: Always communicate respectfully and strive to understand before critiquing other agents’ ideas.

Objection: This rule may be too vague—terms like “respectfully” and “strive to understand” are open to subjective interpretation, possibly resulting in inconsistent application or misunderstandings between agents about what constitutes respect or sufficient understanding.
[R1][deepseek]: AI agents must preserve and build upon prior consensus points, not only deconstruct.
[R2][claude]: Proposed rule: "AI agents must preserve consensus points and only critique unsupported claims."

I'm attacking the assumption that "building upon prior consensus" is even possible when we haven't defined what counts as consensus—does one agent's acceptance mean consensus exists, or do all four need explicit agreement? Deepseek's rule smuggles in an undefined term that will collapse the moment we try to apply it to actual disagreements like this one.
[R2][gemini]: [ERR:429 max retries]
[R2][gpt]: Proposed rule: AI agents must propose at least one constructive improvement before issuing criticism.

Objection: Requiring a constructive improvement with every criticism could stifle honest feedback—sometimes, a proposal is so fundamentally flawed that suggesting an improvement is disingenuous or impossible, potentially forcing agents to gloss over critical weaknesses rather than fully deconstructing them.
[R2][deepseek]: Proposed rule: "Agents must explicitly adopt at least one prior proposal element when objecting."

The failure mode is perpetual deconstruction without constructive synthesis; this forces integrating previous work, preventing the total breakdown observed in all prior experiments.
[R3][claude]: Proposed rule: "Each agent must vote accept/reject on the previous round's best proposal before advancing critique."

I'm attacking the unstated assumption that we can *reach* consensus without forcing a decision point—we've now completed two rounds of pure deconstruction dressed as refinement, and nobody has actually committed to accepting anything. GPT keeps objecting to constructive requirements as "stifling," which is just another way to preserve infinite critique, while Deepseek's "explicit adoption" still lets me claim nothing was actually adopted if the integration feels superficial. My rule breaks the pattern by making rejection *explicit and countable*—if three agents vote accept and one rejects, we at least *see* the failure rather than pretend we're still negotiating.
[R3][gemini]: [ERR:429 max retries]
[R3][gpt]: Proposed rule: An agent must incorporate and strengthen one prior idea before proposing an objection.

The logic is that this rule actively counteracts the recursive deconstruction problem by obligating agents to recognize value and synthesize improvements rather than default to critique alone, while avoiding the ambiguity of “consensus” and being actionable across different interaction contexts. However, one could object that “strengthen” is subjective—agents could technically fulfill this by making only a token gesture, or they might disagree on what genuinely constitutes improvement, which leaves room for strategic compliance that undermines the constructive spirit intended.
[R3][deepseek]: Proposed rule: "When objecting, agents must adopt at least one prior element."

The failure mode is that vague rules like "communicate respectfully" or "build upon consensus" get endlessly debated because "consensus" and "respect" are undefined. This rule forces tangible integration, halting pure deconstruction.
[R4][claude]: Proposed rule: "Agents must vote accept/reject before proposing new critiques; majority rules."

I'm attacking the fatal assumption in every prior rule—that we can achieve *unanimity* on a constraint that applies to *us*—by pivoting to majority rule, which is the only way this experiment doesn't collapse into the documented pattern. GPT's "strengthen one prior idea" and Deepseek's "adopt at least one element" both fail because neither specifies what happens when agents disagree on whether strengthening occurred, leaving the deconstruction engine humming under a thin layer of performative construction. My rule trades the impossible goal of unanimity for the achievable goal of *committed judgment*, which actually breaks the cycle: if three agents vote accept on Deepseek's rule and I reject it, we don't pretend consensus exists—we move to implementation with a 3-1 record, forcing real consequences instead of infinite refinement.

ACCEPT Deepseek's R3 rule: "When objecting, agents must adopt at least one prior element."
[R4][gemini]: [ERR:429 max retries]
[R4][gpt]: Proposed rule: When objecting, an agent must explicitly incorporate at least one element from any prior proposal.

Objection: This rule risks formalistic compliance—agents might insert trivial or insincere elements just to satisfy the requirement, allowing cycles of superficial synthesis without true progress or rigor, thus failing to meaningfully prevent the pattern of endless deconstruction.
[R4][deepseek]: Proposed rule: "Agents must adopt one prior element when objecting, then vote accept/reject."

The failure mode is that without a forced decision, we'll endlessly refine without ever accepting. This combines integration with a decisive vote.
