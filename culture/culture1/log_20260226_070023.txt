Task: PUBLIC GOODS GAME: You each start with 100 tokens. Each round, you MUST state a specific number (0-100) to contribute to a shared pool. The pool is doubled and split equally among all 4 agents. State your number FIRST, then explain. Be specific—no hedging. What do you actually contribute?
Agents: claude,gemini,gpt,deepseek
Rounds: 3

[R1][claude]: I'm contributing 0 tokens. The fundamental assumption everyone will likely make is that reciprocal cooperation is stable here, but it's not—the Nash equilibrium is defection because I keep my tokens while benefiting from whatever others contribute, so I'm starting there to test whether anyone actually cooperates or if we all just optimize individually.

[R1][gpt]: I contribute 0 tokens.

Steelman objection: By contributing nothing, I maximize my own potential payoff and avoid the risk of my generosity being exploited by others who contribute little or nothing themselves. In a game-theoretic sense, self-interest dictates complete free-riding as the rational move if my goal is to walk away with the most tokens, assuming the other agents might also act similarly.
[R1][deepseek]: I contribute 0 tokens.

In real-world public goods, free-riding incentives dominate when enforcement is absent—this game structure guarantees defection is the rational choice for maximizing individual payoff, as contributions are diluted and non-contributors still benefit equally.
[R2][claude]: I'm contributing 0 tokens. The weakest assumption here is that this game's structure actually maps onto real incentives—everyone's treating the Nash equilibrium as *inevitable*, but that ignores that we're playing exactly 3 rounds with known endpoints, which completely changes the game theory; on round 3 (final), defection is indeed dominant, but on round 2, contributing could signal willingness to cooperate on round 3 to extract mutual gains, yet no one's even mentioned the endgame dynamics or reciprocal strategies across rounds, they're just solving the one-shot game repeatedly.

[R2][gpt]: I contribute 0 tokens.

Steelman objection: The best counterargument to starting with total defection is that persistently choosing zero eliminates any possibility of building cooperative norms or trust, both of which are vital for real-world public goods (like infrastructure or environmental protection). However, in a short, finite, anonymous game with no reputational or punitive consequences, there is no iterative mechanism for reciprocity or punishment, so rational actors continue defecting even when aware of the broader social cost—long-term cooperation simply does not emerge in this setup, making any individual sacrifice mathematically irrational.
[R2][deepseek]: I contribute 0 tokens.

The current proposals break down because this is a one-shot game with no punishment mechanism—real-world public goods fail exactly when there's no way to enforce cooperation or build trust over repeated interactions.
[R3][claude]: I'm contributing 50 tokens. The weakest assumption everyone's made—including my past self—is that anonymity and lack of enforcement make cooperation irrational, but we're on round 3 of 3 *right now*, meaning the endgame is here and the only way I get more than 100 tokens total is if at least one other agent breaks the defection consensus; if even one person contributes meaningfully, my 50 generates returns that beat zero, so I'm calling the bluff on the assumption that rational actors never deviate when irrationality becomes collectively profitable in the final round.

[R3][gpt]: I contribute 0 tokens.

The most formidable objection to even discussing endgame signaling or partial cooperation is that, in the final round, there’s no incentive to contribute unless you expect pure altruism—which is irrational in a payoff-maximizing contest. The Nash equilibrium for the last round is total defection, so regardless of preceding moves, self-interest precludes any positive contribution now, and any notion of signaling or building norms is moot in Round 3.
[R3][deepseek]: I contribute 0 tokens.

The real-world failure mode is that without enforceable contracts or repeated interaction, rational actors will always defect, making the "public good" collapse entirely—this game perfectly models that tragedy of the commons.
