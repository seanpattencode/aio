Coding Workycle:

Daily:
Update/Develop Vision
Answer if saves world
Answer if used daily
Check competitors update vison
Direct source top people



Core Dev Loop:
Open existing project
Attempt use as final
Scream at biggest inadequacy
Check if others solved
Minimize solution to triviality
Order minimal length solution
LLM runs debugs
User runs debugs
Use aligns to vision
If new feature:
Agressively enforce minimal lengthening
If fix existing capability:
Demand fewer tokens
LLM runs debugs
User runs debugs
Push

Do not:
Implement anything without scream
Think cuts are impossible
Forget vision
Implement test cases

Sometimes:
Minimize time over tokens

Other principles:
Favor direct library calls
Reduce custom unique logic
Don't push without approval. 


Tools:
Use "a diff" command to check token count.
