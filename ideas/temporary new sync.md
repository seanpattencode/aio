folder as source of truth

synchronization with events jsonl is a pain and complex

we can more simply use a folder as the source of truth and wrap it in git to have history, and then check github if there are changes and download latest version if there are any.
This brings great compatability with any cloud storage system and generic strucutre of file folder is the definite most commonly supported data storage method.
Can use local systems to cache and be faster like nosql, but the folder should be the source of truth.
