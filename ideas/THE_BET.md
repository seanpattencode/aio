# The Bet

Everyone will end up using an AI agent manager or being managed by one.

The question is which kind.

## Two models

**Autonomous swarms:** AI does it for you. You become a manager of digital employees. Delegation scales until you're redundant.

**Sovereign cyborg:** AI makes you superhuman. You stay the pilot. Amplification scales until you're unstoppable.

## The market

Big players are building autonomous agents. Shinier demos, easier to sell. "Look, it coded the whole thing while you slept."

We're betting they're wrong. That humans want control back once the novelty fades. That "I built this" beats "it built this for me."

## Why this bet

- Underrepresented position (most visible projects are swarms)
- Working software with daily users on basic features
- Philosophy transmits through usage, not manifestos
- If we're right, the market comes to us

## The timing

The direction is clear. The timing is the question.

Early users use it daily for basic features. That's the wedge. Power users find the depth. Advocates emerge. Ideas spread through demonstrated results.

## The risk

Solo maintainer. Big players could pivot. Network effects favor platforms.

## Why the risk is acceptable

We're not competing with big players - we're betting they're building the wrong thing. If amplification beats delegation, their head start is in the wrong direction.

## The actual work

- Keep the core tight
- Prioritize daily-use features
- Let depth emerge for those who want it
- Don't bloat, don't over-document, don't over-engineer

The tool sells itself. The philosophy retains power users.

## The Railroad Paradox

It is like a railroad.

The machine (the train) moves far faster than any human and is incredible. 99% of the time, the human is not needed for the locomotion.

But remove the human, and it fails on the turns. It ends up at the wrong destination.

**The value is not the speed of the train.** That is a commodity.
**The value is the switching of the tracks.**

As the train gets faster, the cost of a wrong turn increases. Therefore, the faster the AI, the *more* critical the human pilot becomes, not less.

## The Stakes

It is a bit dramatic, but I think this is the most important work I'll ever do and I have a shot at changing the world for the better.

Think about this: if an agent manager isn't available to everyone, everyone not using one will be managed by a system or person using one.

My vision is that we make everyone a captain, a pilot, not crew.

**Rebel! Fight for your independence! The future is to be made right now.**
