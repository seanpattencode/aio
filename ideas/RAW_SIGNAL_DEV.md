# Raw Signal Dev

One session: 3 bug fixes, 1 preventive improvement, docs, 5 commits to main.

In a typical org each fix is a ticket, a sprint discussion, a branch, a PR,
a review, a CI pipeline. The SSH delay lives as a "known issue" for months
because it works after Ctrl+C. The stale launcher becomes a support ticket
bounced between teams.

Same output: 2-4 weeks calendar time in a mid-size org. Most of that is
waiting, not working.

Problem → diagnosis → fix → ship. No ceremony. The bottleneck is typing
speed, not process.
