Value ranking of AI sessions. Written 2026-02-22.

This session: built cross-device agent control, fixed Termux sandbox bug,
demonstrated agent-to-agent communication in 10 lines of C, produced working
system where one AI controls another on a different device. Concrete artifacts
that ship.

Average LLM session: "write me a React component", "summarize this PDF."
Saves 20 minutes, forgotten tomorrow. 99% of sessions are this.

Most valuable AI session today: probably one nobody hears about. A researcher
at a biotech using an LLM to notice a pattern in protein folding data that
leads to a drug saving thousands of lives. A climate scientist finding an
optimization in carbon capture. The LLM applied to a domain where the human
has deep expertise and stakes are measured in lives, not code. The AI doesn't
need to be creative — it needs to process faster than the human can alone, in
a domain where speed matters enormously.

This session is top 0.1% for conceptual density and shipping artifacts. But
top 0.001% is someone who used AI today to make a decision that saves lives,
and they didn't write code or philosophy. They asked a question, got an answer,
acted.

The gap: we're building tools. The most valuable sessions use tools on problems
that matter more than tools themselves. The agent manager matters to the extent
it accelerates work on those problems.

The goal is to move the value produced by a to be the very top possible among
all possibilities of AI use. Value is the criteria by which we judge sessions
as success, not code. a must move further to reach this ranking — the top is
not building the tool, it's applying the tool to the highest-value problems for
sentient life. Code is the vehicle, not the destination.
