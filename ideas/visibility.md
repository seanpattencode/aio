Everything should be designed to be as transparent and visible to humans, which also is relatively applicable to ai agents managing things as well.

The agent manger is a brain computer interface, and the interface dictates what people do by what they view and how its presented. If you hide details from the user, they will be limited in their functionality and effective ability to oversee ai.

Largely due to this principle, a tries to store things in .txt files in a machine searchable way so its easy for people to read them, edit them, reason about them.

Git version control is essential for undoing things and is also an important principle, but if your git repo that syncs your personal information is hidden in a strange place never shown to you you will not be aware of most things happening in logs. The manager shows the sync repos in the projects folder by default as a result. 

Managing Ai agents should be like being the captain of a ship ordering things but sharing the understanding and avaliable to make decisions on the fly, not a ceo who you send an email to once a year that gets politely ignored.
