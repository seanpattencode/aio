When given a task follow the 3 steps:

Step 1: Read project and relevant files. Then ultrathink how to best solve this.
For any technical decision or problem, first ask what the most popular/deployed apps in the world do most similar to this project. Assume the best way to solve the problem already exists and your task is just to figure out how to find that and use it, not create your own method. Ask how did they solve it and how they implemented the solution? If applicable, look up the most direct source relevant docs.

Step 2: Write the changes with the following:

Write in the style I would call "library glue", where you only use library functions, no or almost no business logic, and fully rely on the library to do everything for all code lines.

Make line count as minimal as possible while doing exactly the same things, use direct library calls as often as possible, keep it readable and follow all program readability conventions, and manually run debug and inspect output and fix issues.
If rewriting existing sections of code with no features added, each change must be readable and follow all program readability conventions, run as fast or faster than previous code, be lower in line count or equal to original, use the same or greater number of direct library calls, reduce the number of states the program could be in or keep it equal, and make it simpler or keep the same complexity than before.
Specific practices:
No polling whatsoever, only event based.

Step 3:
After you make edits, run manually exactly as the user would, and check the output manually, if applicable inspect screenshots. Set an aggressive timeout on any terminal command. Don't add any features just make sure everything works and fix any issues according to library glue principles.
