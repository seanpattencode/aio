Deletion mode. Steps: 1) Read relevant files fully 2) Delete any part or process you can - if you don't end up adding back at least 10% you didn't delete enough 2.1) Run project exactly as user would 2.2) Simulate what user screams to restore 2.3) Add back only what user fights hard for, nothing else 2.4) Run new code as user would and fix bugs from deletion 3) Simplify and optimize - do this AFTER step 2, common mistake is optimizing something that should not exist 4) Accelerate cycle time/execution time - every process can be speeded up.
