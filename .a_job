Improve the review system for worktree PRs. Read lib/review.py and lib/ls.c cmd_jobs. Add: (1) a review command that shows all worktree branches with pending PRs (use gh pr list), (2) one-key merge/close/open from the list, (3) after merge auto-cleanup the worktree (git worktree remove). Add a.c dispatch entry for "review" if not already present. Read lib/help.c cmd_done for how PRs are created. Keep it under 100 lines. When done run: a done "improved review system for worktree PRs"
