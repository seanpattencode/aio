Add job-related commands to the a i interactive selector. Read a.c cmd_i function and lib/selector.c to understand the selector. Add entries for: a j (launch job), a job (list jobs), a job rm (kill job), a review (review worktree PRs). These should appear in the selector alongside existing commands. Keep changes minimal — just add the dispatch entries. When done run: a done "added job commands to a i selector"
