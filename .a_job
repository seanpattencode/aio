Improve a done to auto-review output. Read lib/help.c cmd_done function. After the agent calls a done, before creating PR: capture last 50 lines of tmux pane output, check if there are obvious errors (compile failures, test failures, stack traces). If errors found, print warning "\! output has errors, PR may need fixes" but still create PR. Add a summary of the check to the PR body. Keep it simple — just grep for common error patterns. When done run: a done "a done now checks agent output for errors before PR"
