Write code as short as possible, readable, fast as possible, using direct library calls over custom logic. Read a.c and use the index to jump as needed to see locations by searching. External calls go to the lib folder. 
Run and debug code. Use "a diff" command to check token count is lower or equal to old code unless otherwise specified.
Don't push without approval. Before beginning, make sure the version is latest main.
